        <h2><em>About the City</em></h2>

        <p style="font-size: large">
          The City of San Fernando, La Union is a coastal city with fifty-nine
          (59) barangays covering an area of 105.26 square kilometers. The city
          is a bustling commercial and administrative hub located in the
          geographical center of the Province of La Union. It serves as the
          gateway to trade and commerce to the North and the culture andheritage
          of Ilocandia.
          <br />
          <br />
          The City is the regional and administrative capital of Region I,
          hosting several regional and field offices of national government
          agencies, regional branches of government financial institutions and
          some government owned and controlled corporations. It is the home to
          some of the region’s best educational and medical institutions and
          facilities including the Ilocos Training and Regional Medical Center
          (ITRMC), which is acknowledged as the heart of public health and
          medical care in Region 1.

          <br />
          <br />
          In 2018, the City has a projected population of 131,250. Daytime
          population increases to about 38% due to the influx of workers,
          students and people doing business or government transactions in the
          city. San Fernando is a transient city that caters to a working and
          student population that commutes home to nearby municipalities and
          provinces, and passing travelers.
          <br />
          <br />
          The City’s populace is the central focus of development especially the
          poor, disadvantaged and marginalized groups. This is in line with the
          City’s strategic vision to become a People’s City. To attain this, the
          City identified and incorporated four pillars into its inter-sectoral
          plans and thrusts. These are (1) Social Development Sector; (2)
          Economic Development Sector; (3) Environmental Management Sector; and
          (4) Administrative Governance Sector.
