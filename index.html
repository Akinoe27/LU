            <h2><em>History</em></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>San Fernando, along with all the southern coastal towns of La Union were once called Agoo in pre-colonial
                times.[citation needed] Agoo was the northern part of Caboloan (Pangasinan), covering a large area that
                encompassed the
                towns of “Atuley” (San Juan), San Fernando, Bauang, Caba, “Alingay or Alinguey” (Aringay), Santo Tomas
                and
                Rosario.[citation needed]

                When Juan de Salcedo a Spanish, explored the area in June 1572, he and his men were involved in a
                skirmish with 3
                Japanese ships. He discovered that there was a settlement in the area, occupied by Japanese and Chinese
                merchants. The
                incident earned Agoo the name “El Puerto de Japon,” the Japanese Port. Agoo was heavily involved in
                trade with other
                neighboring Southeast Asian countries. Agoo's role as an ancient port eventually deteriorated when the
                Spanish closed
                the Philippines to foreign trade.

                The origins of the capital city of the province of La Union date back to the formal creation of the
                municipality or
                Ministerio de San Fernando which coincided with the founding of the Parish of San Fernando, Augustinian
                friar Jose
                Torres on May 6, 1786, in honor of King Ferdinand of Spain. San Fernando was formerly called “Pindangan”
                from the word
                “pindang” which was a traditional method of drying fish. Pindangan was formed in 1759 from the union of
                two sitios -
                “San Vicente de Balanac” and “San Guilermo de Dalangdang” - for mutual protection against marauding
                pirates from the sea
                and headhunters from the mountains. Augustinian friar Jose Torres also had the Pindangan church built
                but a massive
                earthquake in the 1760s left the church in total ruin - except for the massive buttresses that still
                stand today, known
                as the Pindangan Ruins.

                Named after Saint Ferdinand III of Castile, San Fernando was founded in 1786. That same year, instead of
                rebuilding the
                Pindangan church, the Franciscans decided to build a new one in honor of San Guillermo. This is now the
                Cathedral of St.
                William the Hermit situated at the center of San Fernando City.

                On October 29, 1849, Governor General Narciso Zaldua Claveria issued a “promovido” combining the eight
                northern towns of
                Pangasinan, three southern towns of Ilocos Sur due south of the Amburayan River, and 8 western
                settlements of Benguet or
                Eastern Pais del Igorotes in the Cordilleras into the province La Union. On March 2, 1850, Governor
                General Antonio
                Maria Blanco signed the “Superior Decreto” of La Union, with San Fernando as the “cabecera,” the
                capital, and with
                Captain Toribio Ruiz de la Escalera as the first Gobernador Militar y Politico. Its creation as a
                province was formally
                approved by a Royal Decree issued by Queen Isabela II of Spain on April 18, 1854.

                From 1896 until 1898, during the Philippine Revolution, the Spanish garrison of San Fernando was
                attacked by Filipino
                revolutionaries under Manuel Tinio y Bundoc and Mauro Ortiz. Spanish administration ceased; a short
                while later, The
                Spanish ceded the country to the Americans in the 1890s. The United States acquired control over the
                country by the
                Treaty of Paris following the events of the Spanish–American War.

                From its inception as the capital of La Union up to the Second World War, San Fernando experienced
                monumental
                transformations in the socio-cultural and politico-economic aspects. After World War II, rehabilitation
                and
                reconstruction were done, eventually propelling the city as the center of commerce and trade and the
                administrative
                center of Region I.</p>
