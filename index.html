            <h2><em>History of the Philippine Goverment</em></h2>
            <p>The Philippines has a representative democracy modeled on the U.S. system. The 1987 constitution,
                adopted during the
                Aquino administration, reestablished a presidential system of government with a bicameral
                legislature and an independent
                judiciary.</p>

            <h2><em>Philippine Goverment Structure</em></h2>
            <p>The government of the Philippines (Filipino: Pamahalaan ng Pilipinas) has three interdependent
                branches: the
                legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The Philippines is governed as a unitary state under
                a presidential
                representative and democratic constitutional republic in which the president functions as both the
                head of state and the
                head of government of the country within a pluriform multi-party system.
                The powers of the three branches are vested by the Constitution of the Philippines in the following:
                Legislative power
                is vested in the two-chamber Congress of the Philippinesâ€”the Senate is the upper chamber and the
                House of
                Representatives is the lower chamber.[1] Executive power is exercised by the government under the
                leadership of the
                president. Judicial power is vested in the courts, with the Supreme Court of the Philippines as the
                highest judicial
                body.</p>
